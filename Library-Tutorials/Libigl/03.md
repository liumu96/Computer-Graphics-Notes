# Overview

Libigl is an open source C++ library for **geometry processing** research and development.

Libigl relies heavily on the Eigen library for dense and sparse linear algebra routines. Besides geometry processing routines, libigl has linear algebra routines which bootstrap Eigen and make it feel even more similar to a high-level algebra library such as Matlab.
