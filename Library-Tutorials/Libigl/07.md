# Overview

Libigl is an open source C++ library for **geometry processing** research and development.

Libigl contains a wide variety of geometry processing tools and functions for dealing with meshes and the linear algebra related to them: far too many to discuss in this introductory tutorial. Weâ€™ve pulled out a couple of the interesting functions in this chapter to highlight.
