The main advantage of a position based approach is its controllability. Overshooting problems of explicit integration schemes in force based systems can be avoided. In addition, collision constraints can be handled easily and penetrations can be resolved completely by projecting points to valid locations. We have used the approach to build a real time cloth simulator which is part of a physics software library for games. This application demonstrates the strengths and benefits of the method.                         | âœ…       |
| XPBD: Position-Based Simulation of Compliant Constrained Dynamics [paper](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/XPBD.pdf) [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzy6u1z_l9A) [note] () [code] () | 2016 | We address the long-standing problem of iteration count and time step dependent constraint stiffness in position-based dynamics (PBD). We introduce a simple extension to PBD that allows it to accurately and efficiently simulate arbitrary elastic and dissipative energy potentials in an implicit manner. In addition, out method provides constraint force estimates, making it applicable to a wider range of applications, such those requiring haptic user-feedback. We compare our algorithm to more expensive non-linear solvers and find it produces visually similar results while maintaining the simplicity and robustness of the PBD method. | Reading  |
